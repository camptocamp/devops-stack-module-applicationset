= devops-stack-module-applicationset

A https://devops-stack.io[DevOps Stack] module to deploy a generic ApplicationSet in Argo CD.

== Usage

You can instantiate this module using the example below:

[source,terraform]
----
module "helloworld_apps" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-applicationset.git?ref=<RELEASE>"

  depends_on = [module.argocd]

  name                   = "helloworld-apps"
  argocd_namespace       = local.argocd_namespace
  project_dest_namespace = "*"
  project_source_repos = "https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"

  generators = [
    {
      git = {
        repoURL  = "https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"
        revision = "main"

        directories = [
          {
            path = "apps/*"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
  template = {
    metadata = {
      name = "{{path.basename}}"
    }

    spec = {
      project = "helloworld-apps"

      source = {
        repoURL        = "https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"
        targetRevision = "main"
        path           = "{{path}}"

        helm = {
          valueFiles = ["values.yaml","secrets.yaml"]

          # The following value defines this global variables that will be available to all apps in apps/*
          # These are needed to generate the ingresses containing the name and base domain of the cluster.
          values = <<-EOT
            cluster:
              name: "${module.eks.cluster_name}"
              domain: "${module.eks.base_domain}"
          EOT
        }
      }

      destination = {
        name      = "in-cluster"
        namespace = "{{path.basename}}"
      }

      syncPolicy = {
        automated = {
          allowEmpty = false
          selfHeal   = true
          prune      = true
        }
        syncOptions = [
          "CreateNamespace=true"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
----

This module first creates an Argo CD AppProject called `helloworld-apps` that will contain all other resources.

Then, it creates an Application called `helloworld-apps` that itself only contains an homonymous ApplicationSet, which is created from the chart inside this repository and using the variables given on the instantiation (`name`, `generators`, and `template`).

image::./images/argocd_appset.png[]

It is this ApplicationSet that will contain all the applications you have in the repository you defined in `repoURL`, in this example is `helloworld`.

image::./images/argocd_app.png[]

As you can see, the ApplicationSet template we give here is flexible enough that it can be configured as you like. For example, since we defined the path in the generator as a wildcard `apps/*`, we can also take this value to then name each application created depending on name of the folder where the chart is located.

=== Using a private repository

When your charts are stored inside a private repository, Argo CD needs to have the credentials necessary to have at least read access to the contents of the repository.

This module has 2 variables you can use for that, depending on the type of credentials you want to configure, either HTTPS or SSH.

==== SSH

You'll need to pass a string containing a private SSH key in the variable `source_credentials_ssh_key` (you can pass the value however you want, as long as it is a string) and the repository needs to be of the type `git@address.com:owner/repository`.

IMPORTANT: Do not hardcode your SSH private key as the example below! Either create the SSH key using Terraform and pass the output directly or use SOPS to store and pass the key as a secret. 

[source,terraform]
----
module "helloworld_apps" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-applicationset.git?ref=<RELEASE>"

  depends_on = [module.argocd]

  name                   = "helloworld-apps"
  argocd_namespace       = local.argocd_namespace
  project_dest_namespace = "*"
  project_source_repos = "git@github.com:camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"

  source_credentials_ssh_key = "-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----\nfoo\nbar\n-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----"

  generators = [
    {
      git = {
        repoURL  = "git@github.com:camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"
        revision = "main"

        # ...

      }
    }
  ]
  template = {
    metadata = {
      name = "{{path.basename}}"
    }

    spec = {
      project = "helloworld-apps"

      source = {
        repoURL  = "git@github.com:camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"

        # ...

      }
      
      # ...

    }
  }
}
----

==== HTTPS

You'll need to pass the username and password inside the variable `source_credentials_https` and the repository needs to be of the type `https://address.com/owner/repository`.

IMPORTANT: Do not hardcode your password the example below! It is recommended to pass the value as secret, either using SOPS or another provider. Another best practice would be to use a token you created on Github.com (or another provider) that has the least amount of access needed (in these use-case, Argo CD only needs read access).

[source,terraform]
----
module "helloworld_apps" {
  source = "git::https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-module-applicationset.git?ref=<RELEASE>"

  depends_on = [module.argocd]

  name                   = "helloworld-apps"
  argocd_namespace       = local.argocd_namespace
  project_dest_namespace = "*"
  project_source_repos = "https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"

  source_credentials_https = {
    username = "your_username"
    password = "your_token_password"
    https_insecure = false
  }

  generators = [
    {
      git = {
        repoURL  = "https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"
        revision = "main"

        # ...

      }
    }
  ]
  template = {
    metadata = {
      name = "{{path.basename}}"
    }

    spec = {
      project = "helloworld-apps"

      source = {
        repoURL  = "https://github.com/camptocamp/devops-stack-helloworld-templates.git"

        # ...

      }
      
      # ...

    }
  }
}
